# Real time e-commerce & Big Data analysis

## Description

Big data implies queries for sites with a lot of information incoming per second in volume and variety that needs to be analyzed. This project is an end-to-end simulated real time big data analysis for an e-commerce site, with a final infrastructure that can be scalable and applied to other big data cases.

## Learning Objectives

* Put into practice what was learned during the Foundations phase at Holberton School.
* Highlights a Student’s unique interests and background when networking, or interviewing with potential employers.
* Provides a realistic workplace scenario where engineers create a solution to fit loosely defined requirements, break this down into concrete tasks and implement on a deadline.
* Allows for self-directed learning to explore a new technical topic, deepen understanding of a curriculum-covered topic, or use technology to bring an idea to life.

## Tecnologies

Ingesting and analyzing data in a project was not usually a problem: enter the data, store in a SQL, take your time, analyze and deploy the results, no big deal. However the data explosion of the last decades of peta (10\**15) or exa (10**18) in volume, velocity, and variety had led software engineers to develop new technologies.
Google has made a big step in these new technologies (2000’s) and since then open source projects have developed the main software of distributed technologies in these areas.
